#### Briefly About Myself:

        had a small business in the field of education.

#### Code example:
        Usually when you buy something, you're asked whether your credit card number, phone number or answer to your most
        secret question is still correct. However, since someone could look over your shoulder, you don't want that
        shown on your screen. Instead, we mask it.

        Your task is to write a function maskify, which changes all but the last four characters into '#'.
```        
            // return masked string
            function maskify(cc) {
            if (cc.length &lt; 5)
                {
                    return cc;
                }
                else {
                    const mask = &quot;#&quot;.repeat(cc.length-4);
                    const open = cc[cc.length-4] + cc[cc.length-3] + cc[cc.length-2] + cc[cc.length-1];
                    return mask + open;
                }
            }
```
